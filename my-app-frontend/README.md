FlatIron P3 Project - The Celebrity/Name Game

-> Create a backend using Active Record/Sinatra that interacts with a React frontend to produce an application version of The Celebrity/Name Game.  Allow players to make guesses of actor's names and progressively track them for the duration of the game.

-> Goals
  Backend:
    1. Create database and tables using Active Record
    2. Connect tables to pertinent models and ensure one-to-many relationship
    3. Forge associations and queries
    4. Provide create/read capabilties for both models, full CRUD for one model
   Frontend:
    1. Create single page application
    2. Use RESTful routes
    3. Ensure all data is using state
    4. Write efficient fetches

Challenges -> 
  1. Ensuring that fetches and returns are simple and efficient
  2. Accurately updating state given these specific actions
